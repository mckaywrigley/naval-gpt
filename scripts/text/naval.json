If you look at modern society, again this is later in the tweetstorm. Businesses that have high creativity and high leverage tends to be ones where you could do an hour of work, and it can have a huge effect. Or you can do 1,000 hours of work, and it can have no effect.For example, look at software engineering. One great engineer can for example create bitcoin, and create billions of dollars worth of value. And an engineer who is working on the wrong thing, or not quite as good, or just not as creative, or thoughtful, or whatever, can work for an entire a year, and every piece of code they ship ends up not getting used. Customers don't want it.That is an example of a profession where the input and the outputs are highly disconnected. It's not based on the number of hours that you put in.Whereas on the extreme other end, if you're a lumberjack, even the best lumberjack in the world, assuming you're not working with tools, so the inputs and outputs are clearly connected. You're just using an ax, or a saw. You know, the best lumberjack in the world may be like 3x better than one of the worst lumberjacks, right? It's not gonna be a gigantic difference.So, you want to look for professions and careers where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected. This is another way of saying that you want to look for things that are leveraged. And by leveraged I don't mean financial leveraged alone, like Wall Street uses, and that has a bad name. I'm just talking about tools. We're using tools.A computer is a tool that software engineers use.

Then they do right by each other because they know this person will be around for the next game.Now of course that doesn't always work because you can make so much money in one move in Silicon Valley, sometimes people betray each other because they're just like, “I'm going to get rich enough off this that I don't care.” So, there can be exceptions to all these circumstances.But essentially if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.So, for example, Warren Buffett has done really well as an investor in the U.S. stock market, but the biggest reason he could do that was because the U.S. stock market has been stable, and around, and didn't get for example seized by the government during a bad administration. Or the U.S. didn't plunge into some war. The underlying platform didn't get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a longterm game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market's stability.","length":2799,"tokens":646},{"title":"When you switch industries, you’re starting over from scratch","html":"<p>In Silicon Valley, the trust comes from the network of people in the small geographic area, that you figure out over time who you can work with, and who you can't.</p><p>If you keep switching locations, you keep switching groups… let's say you started out in the woodworking industry, and you built up a network there.

And you're not going to end up in the right place. You need someone high-energy because the world is full of smart, lazy people. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">We all know people in our life who are really smart, but can't get out of bed, or lift a finger. And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, they work hard, but they're sort of running in the wrong direction.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And smart is not a pejorative. It's not meant to say someone is smart, someone else is stupid. But it's more that everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And then energy, a lot of times people are unmotivated for a specific thing, but they're motivated for other things. So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right? </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Well, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career out of that, rather than wearing a collar around their neck, and going to a dreary job.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you've got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working crook, who's eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals.

You can't just create it, nor can you be the crutch for them if they don't have that intrinsic motivation. So, you have to make sure people actually are high-energy, and want to do what you want them to do, and what you want to work with them on. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Integrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do</b></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Reading signals is very, very important.

So, angry, outraged, vindictive, short-term thinking people are essentially that way in many interactions in real life.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">People are oddly consistent. That's one of the things you learn about them. So, you want to find long-term people. You want to find people who seem irrationally ethical. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">For example, I had a friend of mine whose company I invested in, and the company failed, and he could have wiped out all of the investors. But he kept putting more and more personal money in. Through three different pivots he put personal money in until the company finally succeeded. And in the process, he never wiped out the investors. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And I was always grateful to him for that. I said, “Wow, that's amazing that you were so good to your investors. You didn't wipe them out.” And he got offended by that. He said, “I didn't do it for you. I didn't do it for my investors. I did it for me. It's my own self-esteem. It's what I care about. That's how I live my life.” That's the kind of person you want to work with.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Another quote that I like, I have a tweet on this. I think I read this somewhere else, so I'm not taking credit for this. But I kind of modified it a little bit. Which is that “self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.” You'll always know. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, good people, moral people, ethical people, easy to work with people, reliable people, tend to have very high self-esteem because they have very good reputations with themselves, and they understand that. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">It's not ego. Self-esteem and ego are different things. Because ego can be undeserved, but self-esteem at least you feel like you lived up to your own internal moral code of ethics. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And so it's very hard to work with people who end up being low integrity.

Generally, the more someone is saying that they're moral, ethical, and high integrity, the less likely they are to be that way. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">It's very much like status signalling. If you overtly bid for status, if you overtly talk about being high status, that is a low status move. If you openly talk about how honest, reliable, and trustworthy you are, you're probably not that honest and trustworthy.

You said, “Don't partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">We all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will shoot down everything. Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? He thinks he's being helpful, but he's actually being critical, and he's a downer on everything.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">That person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they'll prevent other people around them from doing something great. They think their job is to shoot holes in things. And it's okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">There's also the classic military line, “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.” And these people want a fourth option, where they don't want to lead, they don't want to follow, but they don't want to get out of the way. They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And all the really successful people I know have a very strong action bias. They just do things. The easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, if you want to be successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, you need to have an action bias towards getting what you want. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Partner with rational optimists</b></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And you have to be optimistic about it. Not irrationally. You know, there's nothing worse than someone who is foolhardy and chasing something that's not worth it.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">That's why I say rational optimist. But you have to be rational. Know all the pitfalls. Know the downsides, but still keep your chin up. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">You've got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? This is the beauty of Elon Musk, and why I think he inspires so many people, it's just because he takes on really, really big audacious tasks. And he provides an example for people to think big. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don't think the corner grocery store owner is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and toil into it. Maybe even more. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">But for whatever reason, education, circumstance, they didn't get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it's just better to think big. Obviously, rationally, within your means, stay optimistic. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The cynics and the pessimists, what they're really saying, it's unfortunate, but they're basically saying, “I've given up. I don't think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so why should you go do something because if you fail, then I'm right, which is great. But if you succeed, then you just make me look bad.”</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>We descended from pessimists</b></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nivi: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Yes, it's probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">There's a completely rational frame on why you should be an optimist. Historically, if you go back 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are wandering through a jungle, they hear a tiger. One's an optimist, and says, “Oh, it's not headed our way.” The other one says, “I'm a pessimist, I'm out of here.” And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, we're descended from pessimists. We're genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street. It's very unlikely that you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Much more likely that the upside is unlimited, and the downside is limited. So, adapting for modern society means overriding your pessimism, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets because the upside is unlimited if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And if you fail, what's the big deal? You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they've got plenty more, and that's the bet they take on the chances that you will succeed.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">It made sense to be pessimistic in the past. It makes sense to be optimistic today, especially if you're educated and living in a First World country. Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin. Ruin means stay out of jail. So, don't do anything that's illegal. It's never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. And stay out of total catastrophic loss. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous, hurt your body. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">You have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. So, don't gamble everything on one go.

You said, “Don't partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”Naval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done. We all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will shoot down everything. Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? He thinks he's being helpful, but he's actually being critical, and he's a downer on everything.That person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they'll prevent other people around them from doing something great. They think their job is to shoot holes in things. And it's okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution. There's also the classic military line, “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.” And these people want a fourth option, where they don't want to lead, they don't want to follow, but they don't want to get out of the way. They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work. And all the really successful people I know have a very strong action bias. They just do things. The easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide. So, if you want to be successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, you need to have an action bias towards getting what you want. Partner with rational optimistsAnd you have to be optimistic about it. Not irrationally. You know, there's nothing worse than someone who is foolhardy and chasing something that's not worth it.That's why I say rational optimist. But you have to be rational. Know all the pitfalls. Know the downsides, but still keep your chin up. You've got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? This is the beauty of Elon Musk, and why I think he inspires so many people, it's just because he takes on really, really big audacious tasks. And he provides an example for people to think big. And it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don't think the corner grocery store owner is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and toil into it. Maybe even more. But for whatever reason, education, circumstance, they didn't get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it's just better to think big. Obviously, rationally, within your means, stay optimistic. The cynics and the pessimists, what they're really saying, it's unfortunate, but they're basically saying, “I've given up. I don't think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so why should you go do something because if you fail, then I'm right, which is great. But if you succeed, then you just make me look bad.”We descended from pessimistsNivi: Yes, it's probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.Naval: There's a completely rational frame on why you should be an optimist. Historically, if you go back 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are wandering through a jungle, they hear a tiger. One's an optimist, and says, “Oh, it's not headed our way.” The other one says, “I'm a pessimist, I'm out of here.” And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten. So, we're descended from pessimists. We're genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street. It's very unlikely that you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin. Much more likely that the upside is unlimited, and the downside is limited. So, adapting for modern society means overriding your pessimism, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets because the upside is unlimited if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world. And if you fail, what's the big deal? You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they've got plenty more, and that's the bet they take on the chances that you will succeed.It made sense to be pessimistic in the past. It makes sense to be optimistic today, especially if you're educated and living in a First World country. Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger. The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin. Ruin means stay out of jail. So, don't do anything that's illegal. It's never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. And stay out of total catastrophic loss. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous, hurt your body. You have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. So, don't gamble everything on one go. But take rationally optimistic bets with big upside.BOCTAOENivi: I think there's people that will try and build up your ideas, and build on your ideas, no matter how far fetched they might seem. And then there are people who list all of the obvious exceptions, no matter how obvious they are.

It's not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job, it's not for going into whatever field investors say is the hottest. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Very often specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It's also stuff that's just being figured out or is really hard to figure out. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, if you're not 100% into it somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you.

He has massive leverage on top of that brand and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Specific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation</strong></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nivi: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge somehow make more sense for it? </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We're talking decades and decades. It's now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The reason I didn't try and change it is because every other term that I found for it was overloaded in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn't that used. I can kind of rebrand it. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it's unique but if I learn it from somebody else it's no longer unique, then we both know it. So, it's not so much that it is unique, it's that it is highly specific to the situation, it's specific to the individual, it's specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">It can't just be read straight out of a single book, nor can it be taught in a single course, nor can it be programmed into a single algorithm. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>You can't be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledge</strong></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nivi: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Speaking of Scott Adams, he's got a blog post on how to build your career by getting in, say, the top 25 percentile at three or more things. And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge? </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">I actually think the best way is just to follow your own obsession. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can realize that, actually, this obsession I like and I'll keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">But I think if you go around trying to build it a little too deliberately, if you become too goal-oriented on the money, then you won't pick the right thing. You won't actually pick the thing that you love to do, so you won't go deep enough into it.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Scott Adams' observation is a good one, predicated on statistics. Let's say there's 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Someone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">But when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you've expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Also, there's diminishing returns. So, it's much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Build specific knowledge where you are a natural</strong></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">I think it's a very pragmatic approach. But I think it's important that one not start assembling things too deliberately because you do want to pick things where you are a natural. Everyone is a natural at something. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">We're all familiar with that phrase, a natural. “Oh, this person is a natural at meeting men or women, this person is a natural socialite, this person is a natural programmer, this person is a natural reader.” So, whatever you are a natural at, you want to double down on that. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And then there are probably multiple things you're natural at because personalities and humans are very complex. So, we want to be able to take the things that you are natural at and combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest and enjoyment, end up top 25% or top 10% or top 5% at a number of things. </span></p>","text":"Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeshipsNaval: To the extent that specific knowledge is taught, it's on the job.

If you look at his girlfriend, she's this beautiful young Instagram model. That is an example of someone who has built up a specific knowledge over the course of his career. It's highly creative, it has elements of being technical in it, and it's something that is never going to be automated. No one's going to take that away from him, because he's also accountable under one brand as Scott Adams, and he's operating with the leverage of media with Periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons and writing books. He has massive leverage on top of that brand and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has. Specific knowledge is specific to the individual and situationNivi: Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge somehow make more sense for it? Naval: You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We're talking decades and decades. It's now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it. The reason I didn't try and change it is because every other term that I found for it was overloaded in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn't that used. I can kind of rebrand it. The problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it's unique but if I learn it from somebody else it's no longer unique, then we both know it. So, it's not so much that it is unique, it's that it is highly specific to the situation, it's specific to the individual, it's specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.It can't just be read straight out of a single book, nor can it be taught in a single course, nor can it be programmed into a single algorithm. You can't be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledgeNivi: Speaking of Scott Adams, he's got a blog post on how to build your career by getting in, say, the top 25 percentile at three or more things. And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile. So, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge? Naval: I actually think the best way is just to follow your own obsession. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can realize that, actually, this obsession I like and I'll keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it.But I think if you go around trying to build it a little too deliberately, if you become too goal-oriented on the money, then you won't pick the right thing. You won't actually pick the thing that you love to do, so you won't go deep enough into it.Scott Adams' observation is a good one, predicated on statistics. Let's say there's 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken. Someone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing. But when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you've expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive. Also, there's diminishing returns. So, it's much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something. Build specific knowledge where you are a naturalI think it's a very pragmatic approach. But I think it's important that one not start assembling things too deliberately because you do want to pick things where you are a natural. Everyone is a natural at something. We're all familiar with that phrase, a natural. “Oh, this person is a natural at meeting men or women, this person is a natural socialite, this person is a natural programmer, this person is a natural reader.” So, whatever you are a natural at, you want to double down on that. And then there are probably multiple things you're natural at because personalities and humans are very complex. So, we want to be able to take the things that you are natural at and combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest and enjoyment, end up top 25% or top 10% or top 5% at a number of things.

He understands the technology well enough that no one's going to snow him on it, and he's not running around making claims that he doesn't think he can't eventually deliver. He may be optimistic on the timelines but he thinks this is within reasonableness for delivery. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Even Steve Jobs developed enough product skills and was involved enough in the product that he also operated in both of these domains. Larry Ellison started as a programmer and I think wrote the first version of Oracle, or was actually heavily involved in it. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Marc Andreessen was also in this domain.

Bill Gates famously paraphrases this as, “I'd rather teach an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.” </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">I think if you start out with a building mentality and you have building skills and it's still early enough in your life, or you have enough focused time that you think you can learn selling, and you have some natural characteristics or you're a good salesperson, then you can double down on those.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Now, your sales skills could be in a different than traditional domain. For example, let's say you're a really good engineer and then people are saying, well, now you need to be good at sales, well, you may not be good at hand-to-hand sales, but you may be a really good writer. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And writing is a skill that can be learned much more easily than, say, in-person selling, and so you may just cultivate writing skills until you become a good online communicator and then use that for your sales. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, it could just be that you're a good builder and you're bad at writing and you don't like communicating to mass audiences but you're good one-on-one, so then you might use your sales skills for recruiting or for fundraising, which are more one-on-one kinds of endeavors. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">This is pointing out that if you're at the intersection of these two, don't despair because you're not going to be the best technologist and you're not going to be the best salesperson, but in a weird way, that combination, back to the Scott Adams skill stack, that combination of two skills is unstoppable. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Long term, people who understand the underlying product and how to build it and can sell it, these are catnip to investors, these people can break down walls if they have enough energy, and they can get almost anything done. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nivi: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">If you could only pick one to be good at, which one would you pick? </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">When you're trying to stand out from the noise building is actually better because there're so many hustlers and sales people who have nothing to back them up.

And that's why microeconomics is important because macroeconomics is a lot of memorization, a lot of macro bullshit. As Nassim Taleb says, it is easier to macro bullshit than it is the micro bullshit. Because macroeconomics is voodoo-complex-science meets politics. You can't find two macroeconomists to agree on anything these days, and different macroeconomists get used by different politicians to peddle their different pet theories. There are even macroeconomists out there now peddling something called Modern Monetary Theory which basically says, hey, except for this pesky thing called inflation, we can just print all the money that we want. Yes, except for this pesky thing called inflation. That's like saying, except for limited energy, we can fire rockets off into space all day long. It's just nonsense, but the fact that there are people who have “macroeconomist” in their title and are peddling Modern Monetary Theory just tells you that macroeconomics as a so-called science has been corrupted. It's now a branch of politics. So, you really want to focus on the foundations. The ultimate foundation are mathematics and logic.

And going back to the business school case study, that's a classic example. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">They study other people's businesses, but in reality, you're going to learn a lot more about running a business by operating your own lemonade stand or equivalent.

You go to Farnam Street, you go to Poor Charlie's Almanack, and you can learn all the different mental models. But which ones matter more? Which ones do you apply more often?

I consider myself extremely good at game theory. I've never opened up a game theory book and found a result in there where I didn't think, “Oh, yeah, that's common sense to me.” </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The reason is that I grew up playing all kinds of games and I ran into all kinds of corner cases with all kinds of friends, and so it's just second nature to me.

Doing encapsulates a lot. For example, let's say, I want to learn how to run a business. Well, if I start a business where I go in every day and I'm doing the same thing, let's say I'm running a retail store down the street where I'm stocking the shelves with food and liquor every single day, I'm not going to learn that much because I'm repeating things a lot. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So, I'm putting in thousands of hours, but they are thousands of hours doing the same thing. Whereas if I was putting in thousands of iterations, that would be different. So, the learning curve is across iterations [not iterations].</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">So if I was trying new marketing experiments in the store all the time, I was constantly changing up the inventory, I was constantly changing up the branding and the messaging, I was constantly changing the sign, I was constantly changing the online channels that are used to drive foot traffic in, I was experimenting with being open at different hours, I had the ability to walk around and talk to other store owners and getting their books and figure out how they run their businesses. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">It's the number of iterations that drives the learning curve.

The ones who are cleaning up your video and audio and transmitting it around the world are already here. The ones who are answering many customer service queries, things that you would have had to call a human for are already here. An army of robots is already here. It's very cheaply available. The bottleneck is just figuring out intelligent and interesting things to do to them. Essentially you can order this army of robots around. The commands have to be issued in a computer language, in a language that they understand. These robots aren't very smart. They have to be told very precisely what to do and how to do it. Coding is such a great superpower because now you can speak the language of the robot armies and you can tell them what to do.Nivi: I think at this point, people are not only commanding the army of robots within servers through code, they're actually manipulating the movement of trucks, of other people. Just ordering a package on Amazon, you're manipulating the movement of many people and many robots to get a package delivered to you. People are doing the same things to build businesses now. There's the army of robots within servers and then there's also an army of actual robots and people that are being manipulated through software.","length":6135,"tokens":1286}]},{"title":"Product Leverage is Egalitarian","length":5919,"tokens":1245,"subsections":[{"title":"The best products tend to be available to everyone","html":"<p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Product leverage is a positive-sum game</b></span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"><b>Naval: </b>Labor and capital are much less egalitarian, not just in the inputs, but in their outputs. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">Let's say that I need something that humans have to provide like if I want a massage or if I need someone to cook my food.
